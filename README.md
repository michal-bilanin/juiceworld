## Project assignment
Create an electronic commerce platform for the company named "JuiceWorld" with the purpose of selling anabolic steroids. The website should offer a user-friendly interface, allowing customers to easily navigate through the available products. Furthermore, the products should possess additional filtering capabilities based on categories (types of anabolics, types of usage...) and manufacturers. It is desired that customers can log in to their accounts to view their order history, while administrators should have the ability to modify various aspects of the products, including their assigned categories and manufacturers.

Moreover, it is requested that the code be made available for retrieval after the completion of the "Milestone 2" phase, enabling deployment on our test server. The code should be obtained exclusively from the master branch, ensuring its reliability and stability. Additionally, we expect the application to be optimized for efficient performance. To achieve this, we require the implementation of a cache mechanism that refreshes every 10 minutes to enhance response times and overall system efficiency.
